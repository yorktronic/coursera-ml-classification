# Coursera Machine Learning Specialization -- Classification #

This repo contains my work for Coursera's Classification course, part of
the Machine Learning Specialization. This course is taught by Carlos Guestrin 
and Emily Fox from the University of Washington. Dr. Guestrin is also an 
Amazon Professor of Machine Learning, and creator of GraphLab Create, a 
machine learning library for Python, which is now part of 
<a href="https://dato.com" target="_blank">Dato's machine learning offerings</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/coursera-ml-classification/tree/master/w1">Week 1</a> ##

Topics include (each number corresponds to a specific week of the course):
 
1. Linear classifiers and logistic regression
2. Learning linear classifiers, overfitting, and regularization in logistic regression
3. Decision trees
4. Preventing overfitting in decision trees, handling missing data
5. Boosting
6. Precisio-recall
7. Scaling to huge datasets and online learning
